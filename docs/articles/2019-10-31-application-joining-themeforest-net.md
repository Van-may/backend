*I was use to application joining the Themeforest.net*

I already know about themeforest long time ago, at the time i didnt know about static generation content system exits, i just like everyone else, who discovery and spending time on searching theme for project on the platform call **Wordpress**, and that moment i know about themeforest, there is a lot of beautiful theme for sales there.

Yesterday, the August 29 of the year 2019, i make my first application for my previous project built here under the name **Ramendaily** as know as **Ramendaily.com The blog and Experience**.

Right now, i'm a new, and the **Non-elite authors** so they just allowed me upload **One (1) new item submission at any time**.

I hope i could reach the **Elite** soon, to catch **Up to 5 items can be in the review queue at any time** upload anytime, that will be great for me to publish some of design and development as an digital product for sell, and make some of money for the living.

That was my first time, and i still dont know about it, and do not make sure i could be approved.

But if it happen, i still do have **3 mores** project save at my laptop to publish to themeforest and ready to sell up. :)

Fews of their request when you want to upload your own product to themeforest, let have a check on this list

## Name & Description

Your item name and description must accurately describe your item and its components. They should both provide relevant information that makes it easy for customers to find items meeting their needs.

The name field should always be relevant, concise, and professional looking. The following are examples of good and bad naming practices:

## Good:

“This is the File Name” – Capitalize the first letter in each word. Small words like “of” and “an” may be lowercase.

“Template with CMS” – Capitalize acronyms and abbreviations like XML and PSD.

“WordPress Template” – Do follow the industry standard even if it doesn’t follow the normal capitalization rules. For example, use jQuery and WordPress instead of Jquery and Wordpress.

## Bad:

“THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE” – Do not use all CAPS.

“this is also not acceptable” – Do not use all lowercase.

“Beautiful File” or “The Best Template” – Do not use subjective words like brilliant, amazing, or best. These words describe your opinion rather than what the file actually is.

“User9909 – File Name” – Do not append your username or any other less-relevant information to the file name.

“Apple-like Design” – Do not describe what your item is similar to in its title, describe what it actually is.

Your description must accurately describe all elements of your main file. Ensure you mention if anything shown in the preview is not included in the main .zip and note if any main element is rasterized, outlined or otherwise not editable. If you're using non-standard fonts in your item, these must be documented in your description. Check out this article for some tips.
