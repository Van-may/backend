*Samyang Beef flavor*

## Samyang ramen – Beef flavor
.88¢

This is an interesting little ditty. I grabbed it this morning thinking that I didn’t want anything that was going to be to out of the ordinary or challenging. Truth be told I was drawn to it by the bold colors and the funny little cartoon character on the front of the package.

I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that this particular variety was spicy. There isn’t anywhere on here that indicated that I was going to be getting a chili inspired edition, just beef. Though a little misleading it was good. The spice is what I would call a level 4 out of 10, not super-oh-my-god-my-brain-is-on-fire-spicy but no where near what my friends would refer to as “using too much pepper and calling it hot”.

The package is really funny. There are bright oranges everywhere on this thing and in retrospect maybe that was intended to indicate the chili flavor without using words. There are great little playful characters from the chef on the front to the heating and serving illustrations on the back.

The only negative thing that I would have to say about it, and this is really minor, is that there is no indication on the flavoring packets which is which. Thankfully you have to put them both in at the same time so it didn’t hurt anything.

Overall, based on the amount of noodles you get (this is one hefty package of noodles) and the fun package I would give it a 7 1/2 out of 10.
