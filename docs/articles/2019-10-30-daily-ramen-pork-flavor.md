## Daily ramen – Pork flavor
.48¢

So this isn’t the worst thing that I have ever had but its by far not one that I would recommend again. The flavor is alright, I never got any pork inclinations which I would have expected from a package that has it emblazoned in magenta on the front. But alas, it didn’t happen. On the bright side there were plenty of little vegetables and the noodles did swell up to look like a lot more than they started out as. On the down side there are little meat balls (I’m guessing they are faux pork inspired) but these little devils don’t have a distinct flavor that I could put my finger on. The one thing that really bothered me was the packet of oil, this thing looked like a packet of congealed bacon grease. If that is what it was and where they were hoping to get the flavor from then we have a problem because it didn’t happen. I wonder if I could get swine flu from that?

The package on this variety is especially loud and seems to have been made by someone with a love of stars. They are under the name (are there 5 of them so that it insinuates five star quality?) and tons of littler ones bordering each side. I have to hand it to them, its eye catching. Not that great but eye catching.

So overall I am going to give this a 5 out of 10. As I said before its not great but not the worst there is out there.
