Verizon DNS Servers & Other ISP Specific DNS Servers

Verizon DNS servers are often listed elsewhere as 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.3, 4.2.2.4, and/or 4.2.2.5, but those are actually alternatives to the CenturyLink/Level 3 DNS server addresses shown in the table above.



Verizon, like most ISPs, prefers to balance their DNS server traffic via local, automatic assignments. For example, the primary Verizon DNS server in Atlanta, GA, is 68.238.120.12 and in Chicago, is 68.238.0.12.
