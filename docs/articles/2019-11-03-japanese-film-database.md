The Japanese Film Database (JFDB) is a database of Japanese films co-managed by the Japan Foundation and UNIJAPAN. Film synopses, cast & staff, and production & distribution company information are searchable and available for public perusal. With the goal of propagating Japanese films abroad, information on theatrically released films as well as the contact details for the companies are provided in both English and Japanese.
