Shimazu Death Haiku



Red as autumn leaves.

I go to my ancestors.

Will they welcome me?

Truly, there is a vast amount of amazing quotes in Total War: Shogun 2.



Considering this is the first result on a Google search of "Shogun 2 quotes," and the entire internet doesn't have record of the all loading screen quotes in this game, I am taking the liberty of registering on this site and recording all quotes once and for all. Based on this, I'm sorry for the necro post. I will include all authors, include all missing quotes, and group by author/source. Remember, in Japan(Nippon in Japanese), family(last) names come first.

Please let me know if I made any mistakes, such as not separating two different quotes. You can tell if there is supposed to be a separation is there is a ',' before a capitalized sentence, and the ',' should almost always be right after a '.' as well.
