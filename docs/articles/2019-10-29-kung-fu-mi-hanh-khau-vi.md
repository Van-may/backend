## Kung Fu (Mì Hành Khâu Vį) – Onion Flavor
.45¢

I was so stoked to have this one after I read the name on the package while putting it in my lunch bucket. Kung-Fu? Kung-Fu!

So what did you have for lunch today?
Why I had a bowl of Kung-Fu!

It sounded so awesome and I was really really excited. Then I had it…

This is supposed to be an onion flavor and to be honest when I made it I did catch a little scent of onion soup. But when I ate it I was really disappointed. On my third day I am getting used to the idea of putting a packet of congealed oil into my bowl to melt and mix with the flavors. It grosses me out a little but I am getting use to the idea. Well I have to say that this one was the reason that I had such apprehension about putting the oil into my dish. All that I could taste was oil, it left a nasty film in my mouth and not even a bag of spicy crackers afterward could strip it all out. Bleck!

Sadly the really potentially cool Kung-Fu can’t even score any points in my book with its package. No cute illustrations, no funny little cartoon characters telling me what to do. Nothing. That having been said I am going to have to give this one a 2 1/2 out of 10. If you are starving and it was down to dying or living I wouldn’t hold it against you for eating this on, otherwise I would have to excommunicate you. Honestly. Because four hours later I am occasionally burping it up and it still tastes bad.
